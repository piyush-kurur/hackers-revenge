* COMMENT Documentation

This document tries to incorporate all the ugliness of
https://dst.gov.in/sites/default/files/UC-12-A.pdf in this one org
file.

1. As always keep a sane org table just below the ~table.el~ main
   table where all calculation is done. You can put it under a
   subsection and hide it by marking it as a ~COMMENT~ much like this
   section.

2. The officials who are supposed to sign the document might change in
   your case. Edit it suitably.
