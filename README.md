Hackers Revenge
===============

As an academic, I am often forced to tolerate, work with, and worse,
be polite to a crowd of administrators, bureaucrats, committee chairs
etc whose idea of a good spread-sheet program is xl-sheets (and
recently google docs and other monstrosities from that company whose
UI has the fine qualities of Vogon poetry). Time to time they demand
all kinds of data from you in certain god given formats. Some of the
characteristics of these formats.

1. A multitude of tables with mult-colum spanning cells

2. Arbitrary numbering of lists -- You have 3.2, 4.i and 42.a in the
   same document.

This repository collects some .org files that I use to deal with some
of these unreasonable demands.
