Hackers Revenge
===============

I am often forced to tolerate, work with, and worse, be polite to a
crowd of administrators, bureaucrats, committee chairs etc whose idea
of a good spread-sheet program is xl-sheets (and recently google docs
and other monstrosities from that company whose UI has the fine
qualities of Vogon poetry). Time to time they demand all kinds of data
from you in certain god given formats. Some of the characteristics of
these formats.

1. A multitude of tables with multi-colum spanning cells. Tables are
   something that administrators like. Firstly, they are ugly. An
   otherwise well typeset document can be ruined by just placing
   tables strategically. Secondly, they have the appearance of perfect
   objectivity when there is none -- Who would not trust the brute
   force of numbers particularly when arranged like the skyline of
   South Mumbai.

2. Arbitrary numbering of lists -- You have 3.2, 4.i and 42.a in the
   same document list. The only point of this scheme of numbering is
   to frustrate the average TeX users (to hell with your
   begin{enumerate}) so much that they might think about the
   libreoffice or some such bloatware.

3. And finally to kill whatever aesthetics is left, all kinds
   interplay of bold and italics fonts.

The sum result of all the above is a document that can be exhibited in
the next Modern-Art festival with not even the shrewdest critic
suspecting any foul play.

This repository collects .org files that I use to deal with some of
these unreasonable demands. They do not try to match every typesetting
fantasy that has ever been dreamt up by these folks, but merely
handles the most obvious things that they look for -- namely tables,
numbering (cross referencing has not been invented in the 21st
century). We use the one weakness that the enemy have --- it is very
difficult for a average office suite (some times rather perversely
called productivity suites) user to match the unreasonable demands of
the bureaucrats. So LaTeX's font selections etc are often forgiven.


A note to prospective users of this code/files. You are dealing with a
formidable enemy here, do not be under any illusion that you can have
your revenge. This is your basic survival kit and if you are lucky,
you may just scrape through. The colourful name for this repository is
just my false sense of bravado.
